Where we choose to allocate this attention will increasingly determine who creates economic value and who destroys economic value.\n \u2013 John Hagel, Co-Chairman, Centre for the Edge\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nIn this age of information abundance, our scarcest commodity is time. The value of attention for an individual or group can be fairly priced in real time driven by market demand and supply functions. An attention marketplace enables the exchange of time blocks that can be broken down into ever smaller increments (e.g. minutes or seconds of an individual\u2019s time) or reaggregated into blocks (e.g. weeks of a group\u2019s time). The size and price of these time blocks are driven by the market demand for the individual or group\u2019s time or attention.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nAttention Sellers:\n supply-side sellers who have time in the form of attention for content consumption, media and advertising, or time bandwidth which can be utilized by employers for tasks or projects.  \n\n\nAttention Buyers:\n demand-side buyers who can buy time whether on an individual basis or bundled into a pool. This time can be strict \n(a particular time block such as Dec 26, 12-1pm)\n or loose \n(blocks of time without a defined interval such as 50 minutes sometime this week)\n. \n\n\nBuyers of time and attention can include the following:\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisers/Marketers\n\n\nHuman capital professionals\n\n\nContract employers and gig economies\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized attention marketplace\n\n\nPing serves as the platform for a new decentralized personal attention marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain. This platform enables attention sellers to sell their future time, and attention buyers to buy them at fair market prices, based on the attention supply-demand of individual sellers.\n\n\nThrough smart contract in the blockchain, attention purchases, redemption, payouts and refunds can be settled programatically in the blockchain ledger without human intervention. Each user has full ownership and authority over their individual attention market instance and its funds. Not even Ping team has access to them, making each attention market instance tamper-proof.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\n@todo: These use case examples are confusing. Needs simplication.\n\n\n\n1. Programmatic marketing and RTB - attention market supply side\n\n\nProgrammatic marketing describes online advertising that is aggregated, booked, analyzed and optimized via demand-side software interfaces and algorithms. RTB (Real-Time Bidding) means that every online ad impression can be evaluated, bought, and sold, all individually, and all instantaneously. It enables exchanges and buyers to work together to programmatically sell and place bids on ads so that impression is placed in front of the right person, at the right time.  \n\n\nConversely, on the attention market supply side, users should be able to take control of how their time and attention is assessed by marketers and attention aggregators such as Facebook and Google.  They should be able to define their affinities for the topics, content types, or publishers, which combined with their availability at any given time and floor price, the time is priced according to the market. In the future, this can be submitted automatically through a calendar import from iCal or Google that allows a personalized, real time attention supply function.  \n\n\n2. Performance-based compensation for contracts or projects\n\n\nReal time performance based compensation is often a challenge, with evaluations occuring quarterly and bonuses often awarded annually.  With the quick turnover of employees in today\u2019s job markets, it is difficult to agilely assess and incentivize highly skilled salaried employees, especially those who work on distributed teams or who work from home.  \n\n\nTeam-based structures also make it challenging for agile completion of tasks across a large organization, as employees who might have been great candidates for a particular project or role may not be able to be officially allocated to that role since it is difficult to be assessed or compensated for projects outside of their core teams.\n\n\nBlockchain enables an agile, performance based compensation that can price an individual\u2019s compensation based on previous performance and completion of a previous task or project.\n\n\nPayout2 = Performance\nPayout1\nCompletion\n\n\nPerformance = Performance score based on history with emphasis on recent performance\nCompletion= boolean for completion as assessed by smart contract\n\n\nReputation = aggregate performance \n\n\n3. Net present value of future time\n\n\nIn the future, we envision that every person and entity may have their own token.  This token can be used to invest in a person\u2019s potential future earnings.  Just as a financial investment can be modeled in Net Present Value (NPV) and a discount rate, this can be modeled as the NPV of a person or entity\u2019s future potential based on the probability and projected value of milestones:\n\n\nNPV = ( (Probability1 \nmilestone 1\nvalue1) + ( Probability2\n milestone 2 \nvalue2) +...  (Probability n \nmilestone n\nvalue 2) ) / discount rate\nFor example, you might support a rising star or athlete by buying his or her coin and receive dividends on their future earnings.  Employer scholarships may achieve immediate liquidity as they are predicated on a person\u2019s potential rather than a contract to work for that employer.",
